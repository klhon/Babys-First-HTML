		<p style="font-size: 26px;">Hi, it's Jaisy here! Welcome to my page!!!</p>
		<img src="pikachuhello.gif">
		<p style="font-size: 20px;">I'm an Asian-American sophomore at Stony Brook University. I double major in information systems and psychology. Digital forensics is the field that I ultimately want to get into. This is all because of the shows CSI: and Criminal Minds. Now, I know these shows don't show forensics accurately, but they introduced the field to me and I will forever be greatful. Besides, they're pretty good shows if you ignore all the mishandlings of evidence. <br><br>Outside of academics, I love to watch movies, listen to K-Pop, and eat delicious food. I enjoy being outdoors a lot. Hiking, biking, running, give me any activity outside and I will probably enjoy it. I'm also a member of the SBU Women's Ultimate Frisbee Team! It's the most fun extracurricular activity I ever did. Along with ultimate frisbee, I'm also learning boxing through a program called Pink Gloves. If you can't already tell, I'm like to be active. BUT this does not include going to the gym.<br><br>Join me on my journey through HTML, college, and life in general!</p>
