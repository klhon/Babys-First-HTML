				Britney E.<br>
				THE team leader who was at the hackathon the whole time. She's also pretty dope at ultimate frisbee.
				</p>
				<p>
				Kellie H.<br>
				The leader's assistant who was also at the hackathon the whole time. She smiles a lot and laughs at nothing (sometimes). But she will kill you 'cause ma gurl works out.	
				</p>
				<p>
				Tiffany C.<br>
				The quiet one. But just because she's quiet, it don't mean you get to step all over her 'cause she will clap back if touched. Also, pretty dope at stepping.
				</p>
				<p>
				Prinn L.<br>
				The international student who has red hair. She's Thai and like Kellie, has no experience with coding. DON'T POKE THE BEAR CUB. She will hurt you. Not only does she step, she also does Thai martial arts.
				</p>
				<p>
				Jaisy L.<br>
				The one who was late to the hackathon by 6 hours 'cause she ain't a good teammate. She can throw a frisbee meh. Just a meh sports enthusiast all around.
