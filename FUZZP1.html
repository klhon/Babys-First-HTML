					Hello! This is Team What the Hack! We are a team of 5 sophomore girls from Stony Brook University. To many's surprise, this is (most of our) first hackathon. Our goal at this hackathon is to simply make a product. We had to scrap our original idea due to its difficulty half way through the hackathon and decided to make a website that showed each of our personalities. Although the product is a simple website, we still faced challenges as it was all of our first time using HTML. This website is the product of our efforts. More information on each member are provided below, as well as buttons going to each of our individual pages.

				<p>
				Britney E.<br>
				The team leader who was at the hackathon the whole time. She's also pretty dope at ultimate frisbee.
				</p>
				<p>
				Kellie H.<br>
				The leader's assistant who was also at the hackathon the whole time. She smiles a lot and laughs at nothing (sometimes). But she will kill you 'cause ma gurl works out.	
				</p>
				<p>
				Tiffany C.<br>
				The quiet one. But just because she's quiet, it don't mean you get to step all over her 'cause she will clap back if touched. Also, pretty dope at stepping.
				</p>
				<p>
				Prinn L.<br>
				The international student who has red hair. She's Thai and like Kellie, has no experience with coding. DON'T POKE THE BEAR CUB. She will hurt you. Not only does she step, she also does Thai martial arts.
				</p>
				<p>
				Jaisy L.<br>
				The one who was late to the hackathon by 6 hours 'cause she ain't a good teammate. She can throw a frisbee meh. Just a meh sports enthusiast all around.
