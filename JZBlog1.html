		<p>
			For some reason, I never really saw the appeal of hackathons. They were relatively boring to me. They didn't sound like a fun experience. Boy was I wrong! <br><br> Why haven't I gone to one earlier? Going to the hackathon was actually a really fun experience. I arrived 6 hours late because I went to frisbee practice, then had to shower, and then had to do laundry. It was a mess, but I went back to the hackathon around 12:00 AM. Prinn was actually going to leave if Tiff and I didn't get back within five minutes (we made it back, you're welcome Prinn)! Our initial project was something related to finding the quickest routes to/from class on-campus, but that idea was scapped because it lacked originality as Brit and Kellie told me. Apparantly one of the MLH guys had told them that, so we went with a simpler project. Our goal was to create something, it was most of our first hackathon after all. We decided on making a website that embodies all of our individual personalities. The website you're reading this on is part of that project. It was super successful in my opinion. Kellie and Prinn had no prior experience with programming and they were able to create pages that they were proud of. I was proud of them, I was proud of us. All of us didn't really know how to use HTML and we were able to create a website despite that inexpereince. I pulled my first all-nighter coding this and by the time the sun rose, we were all tired. Breakfast was promised at 7 AM, but it didn't get served until 8:30 AM. Oh and one of my brackets (I have braces, they're coming off hopefully in 2 weeks) fell off when I was eating popcorn chicken. It was such a hassle. I eventually pulled it out because it got so annoying whenever I ate.<br><br>We went to bed at 9:00 AM and slept ~5 hours, waking up at 3:00 PM. We wanted them free t-shirts. The t-shirts are actually pretty nice though, contrary to my belief. We decided to submit (demo is the technical term) our website because it was a product that we made during our first hackathon, using a language none of us knew how to use. That was how proud we were of our website. The judges were less impressed, but screw them because our website is awesome. The sponsers were more impressed as they admired our website's appearance despite it being our first time coding with HTML. We didn't win any award, but we came out of the hackathon satisfied with our product and excited for the next hackathon because we will kick ass in that one. No more funny business, an all-girls team will win an award!
